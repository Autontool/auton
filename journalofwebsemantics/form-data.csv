When we tried it a year or two ago, it wasn't able to manage the scope of the ontology we had already built (FIBO).  I wonder if its performance is better now.  We still need what it offers (it came up in a discussion just yesterday, but none of us could remember its name.  It was very timely that you sent me this.  Were you listening to our meeting?)","It's potential. It offers a lot of things we need.  I wish we could get it to deliver. ","Let's get back together - see if you can get something working for us.   Our ontology (and supporting governance system) is a lot more mature now, and I bet Ontoology has grown a lot as well.

Just two buttons and one is to come back to the main page. Maybe with an example of the next step (yes, I know, again) could add a better linked and guided vision. 



Stupid things:
In the main web page, the first box in blue maybe is too strong. The step by step page is up-to-date with the how to use it section in the main page? I like the page ""About"" with pointers to the original tools. But I would suggest to have the idea of each tool in three simple images in the main page. To have the a first impression of what Im going to do: As simple as ""Evaluate"", ""Generate documentation"", ... 

The button to delete a repo maybe its too big","The merge is not intrusive in your repo and very well structured. The evaluation report is very well presented.
