        What is OnToology?
        <p>
            A system to automate part of the collaborative ontology development process. Given a repository with an owl
            file, OnToology will survey it and produce diagrams, a complete documentation and validation based on
            common pitfalls.

        How to use it?
        <p>
            Create a repository on GitHub with your ontologies. Add your repo to OnToology (e.g. user/reponame).
            Everything will be generated automatically and a
            <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/" target="_blank">pull request</a>
            will be sent.
            You can visit the progress
            page to see in real time what is going on with your repository. A pull request will be created
            automatically with all of the resources (docs, diagrams, evaluation report, and JSON-LD).
            see the <a href="/stepbystep">Step by Step</a> page for more info.

        How to know what is happening with my repository in real time?

    <li>
        Why ontology documentations doesn't show locally if the index file is opened locally?
        <p>
            This is because chrome by default disables ajax on local html files. It should work with Firefox.
